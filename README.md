Methods Implemented:
1.Linear discriminant function
2.Batch Perceptron Learning algorithm
3.Sequential Perceptron Learning algorithm
4.Sequential Multiclass Perceptron Learning algorithm 
5.MSE via Pseudoinvers
6.Widrow-Hoff Learning Algorithm
7.k-nearest-neighbour classifier
8.Sequential Delta learning rule with H linear threshold
9.Negative feedback network
10.Fisher's evaluation of LDA
11.Singular Value Decomposition
12.Batch Oja's Rule
13.Extreme Learning
14.Sparse Coding
15.Adaptive Boost (Not formal)
16.SVM
